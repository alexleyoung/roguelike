Alex Young's coms 3270 roguelike project. Makefile included with comments.

Assignment 1.04 Features (game_loop/):
- Game struct responsible for game loop, as well as map(s)
- Discrete event simulation powered by generic binary heap written myself
- Character struct for PC and monsters
- Monster spawning logic
- nummon switch to spawn arbitrary num monsters
- movement logic for monsters depending on traits
- bresenham's line-drawing algorithim for LOS

KNOWN ISSUES:
- collision issues resulting in occasional double freeing. deeply troubling bug
  which has been incredibly demoralizing. code is, as a result of debugging efforts, 
  significantly messier.

Assignment 1.03 Features (characters/):

- pathfinding implemented with one dijkstras function (calc_dists)
- flag to enable tunnels or not
- added maps to dungeon struct to store dist maps

Assignment 1.02 Features (saves/):

- save dungeon to binary file according to assignment specification
- load dungeon from binary file
- updated main function to support --save and --load flags, including --load <filename> for testing

Assignment 1.01 Features (gen/):

- random room size + placement
- hardness map
  - place random hardness seeds
  - propagate hardness outward with bfs
  - smooth hardness map with gaussian blur
- corridor generation
  - dijkstra to connect rooms
  - create cycle with inverted dijkstra (invert weights such that previous lowest weight = highest)
- place stairs

Data Structures / Algorithms (dsa/):

- queue for bfs (implemented in class)
- min-heap for dijkstra (custom implementation for my dungeon structure)
- types (for common structs like point)
- generic heap
