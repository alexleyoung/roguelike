Alex Young's coms 3270 roguelike project. Makefile included with comments; TLDR run make to compile to game executable.

Assignment 1.01 Features (gen.c):

- random room size + placement
- hardness map
  - place random hardness seeds
  - propagate hardness outward with bfs
  - smooth hardness map with gaussian blur
- corridor generation
  - dijkstra to connect rooms
  - create cycle with inverted dijkstra (invert weights such that previous lowest weight = highest)
- place stairs

Data Structures / Algorithms (dsa/):

- queue for bfs (implemented in class)
- min-heap for dijkstra (custom implementation for my dungeon structure)
- types (for common structs like point)
